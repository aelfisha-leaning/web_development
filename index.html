          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>Back when i was a kid, i encountered a big bug in the bathroom.</p>
          <p>It was dark and i could almost see the outline of it, sticking to the wall not caring how frightened i was.</p>
          <p>Since then i decided to be a superhero, fighting bugs in the cover of night, saving kids from this horrible experience.</p>

            <li>I can dicharge the electric charge to the ground.</li>
            <li>I can discharge the electric charge to water as well.</li>
            <li>I can light up your dark night with jokes.</li>

          <h2>Langauges</h2>
          <p>I am proud of my native langauge so i only speak it and speak non other.</p>
          <p>You might think i am lazy and i did not invest time into learning a new langauge and that is not wrong.</p>
          <p>I can speak kids langauge, so i can help babysit your kids while you go and do the hero work</p>
